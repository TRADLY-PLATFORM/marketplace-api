## Creating an Account

Before you even start learning using the Edutech Marketplace app, you must create an account. 

As soon as you download the app you will be prompted to choose what kind of service you are looking for. You must indicate here whether you are a STUDENT or a TUTOR. 

You will then create an account using the following credentials :
    First and Last Name
    Email
    Phone Number


You may be asked to verify your contact information by email or by phone number. After you set this up, you should gain access to your app and be on your way to learning!
