PS: If you are going to build something on top of Tradly API, this is how an example app might function like. 

## Creating an Account

Before you even start learning using the Edutech Marketplace app, you must create an account. 

As soon as you download the app you will be prompted to choose what kind of service you are looking for. You must indicate here whether you are a STUDENT or a TUTOR. 

You will then create an account using the following credentials:
- First and Last Name
- Email
- Phone Number


You may be asked to verify your contact information by email or by phone number. After you set this up, you should gain access to your app and be on your way to learning!


## Creating your Profile
After you create your account, the first thing you should do is create your profile. You will see the profile icon on the navigation bar at the bottom of the screen. 

As a student, you will be prompted to fill out the following information :
    - Profile Picture
    - Grade Level
    - Subjects needed tutoring in
    - Location
    - Online or In-person Tutoring
    - Price Range
    - Days and Times available

By filling this out, it helps us generate tutors that match your preferences and your profile information! These tutors should show up on your home screen.


Once you enter the app, you should be able to view different Tutor profiles.


## How to Chat/Book a Tutor
Once you enter the app, you should be able to view different Tutor profiles.
- Narrow down the Tutor you would like to book.
- Click on that Tutor's profile.
- On the bottom of the Tutors profile, there will be two options, one to chat with the tutor and one to book a lesson.

If you click BOOK, you will automatically be taken to a screen to schedule your lesson and book your tutoring lesson.

If you click CHAT, you will taken to the chat screen of the navigation bar where you can send messages, pictures, or anything additional information to your Tutor. You can do this before booking your lesson to get to know the tutor better, or you can utilize it after.
