### Improved store profile pages
The purpose behind to enhance this profile is to increase visibilty of users and allow them to engage

- "About us" section can provide more informations about a store.
- Maketplace operators can add additional fields on account/store creation to increase the trust of buyers about a seller
- Direct chat : Allowing a chat directly from a store leads your users to contact sellers. A new chat means new engagement thus increasing the user retention by keep visiting the app 
  
- Share button: Now the share button is more visible. Which will allow organic share of a certain stores by the users thus increasing new users. 
  
- Store Active and Inactive: Your sellers can now make a store active or inactive based on their business hours, vacation time or even they want to shut down for a while. This way your store operators can enjoy DND and also you can avoid sellers being churned. 

- Reviews and Ratings explictly show on store profiles. 

### Store reviews
Your users can submit reviews of a seller stores/orders, etc. 
- Your users can submit reviews of a store with details and photo of their experience

Coming soon: 
- Marketplace operators able to see the reviews in superadmin 
- Marketplace operators able to see the details of a store Id with review scroll. Thus using the store ID, they can create custom collection widget on app home pages. 

### Promo Banner Enhancement
Adding to the existing way of have promo banner as static and listing as destination. Now
- You can use destination URL as a destination
- You can use store ID as a destination
This helps you to promote a particular store. Plus use external links for other purposes (Example: sending them to a FAQ Page)
