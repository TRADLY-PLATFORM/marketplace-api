## Accessing/Using your Test App
To see active changes being made to your business's Edutech marketplace, you will need to download a test app. This test app will reflect the changes you make to the super admin dashboard progressively.

### iOS
You will receive an email invitation from Tradly to download this tester app on TestFlight. Once you receive this invitation, you should be able to click on the directed link and download the app on your iPhone.

Tradly will also provide a client ID. When your first access the app, you must enter this ID first before you proceed into the app.


From there on, you should be able to see the changes you have made in the super admin dashboard in your app( when you navigate through it)!

### Android
You will receive an email invitation from Tradly to download this tester app on Firebase Distribution. Once you receive this invitation, you should be able to click on the directed link and download the app on your iPhone.

_FUTURE: We are planning to launch a demo app in playstore/appstore for you to directly test the app from there_

For any questions, you may contact Tradly support.
